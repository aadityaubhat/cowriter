# LocalStorage Fixes and Tests

## Issues Fixed

1. **LocalStorage Availability Check**

   - Added `isLocalStorageAvailable()` function to verify if localStorage is available and working properly
   - Implemented checks before any localStorage operations to prevent errors

2. **Error Handling**

   - Added try/catch blocks around all localStorage operations
   - Implemented proper error logging to help with debugging
   - Added fallback behavior when localStorage is unavailable

3. **Data Validation**

   - Added validation to ensure we're working with valid data structures
   - Implemented checks for array types and non-empty arrays
   - Added validation for document IDs and content

4. **Debounced Updates**

   - Implemented a debounce mechanism for document updates
   - Reduced excessive localStorage writes to improve performance
   - Added cleanup for timers to prevent memory leaks

5. **Unique Document IDs**

   - Enhanced document ID generation to ensure uniqueness
   - Combined timestamp with random string to prevent collisions
   - Fixed issues with duplicate documents being created

6. **UI Feedback**

   - Added warning message in the HistorySidebar when localStorage isn't available
   - Improved user feedback about storage status
   - Updated status message at the bottom of the sidebar

7. **Defensive Programming**
   - Added additional checks for edge cases
   - Implemented fallbacks for missing or corrupted data
   - Improved handling of undefined values

## Tests Added

1. **Helper Function Tests**

   - Tests for `isLocalStorageAvailable()`
   - Tests for `loadHistory()` and `saveHistory()`
   - Tests for `loadConfig()` and `saveConfig()`
   - Tests for `createNewDocument()`

2. **Hook Tests**

   - Tests for initializing with new document when no history exists
   - Tests for loading existing history
   - Tests for document management operations (create, delete, rename, update)
   - Tests for handling localStorage unavailability

3. **Test Infrastructure**
   - Set up Jest and React Testing Library
   - Configured Babel for proper transpilation
   - Added mocks for localStorage and other dependencies
   - Created test documentation

## How to Run Tests

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:watch
```

## Future Improvements

1. **Offline Support**

   - Implement a more robust offline storage solution like IndexedDB
   - Add synchronization capabilities for when connection is restored

2. **Data Migration**

   - Add version checking for stored data
   - Implement migration strategies for data structure changes

3. **Enhanced Error Recovery**

   - Implement automatic backup and restore mechanisms
   - Add data integrity checks

4. **Test Coverage**
   - Expand tests to cover more edge cases
   - Add integration tests for the full document lifecycle
   - Implement end-to-end tests for critical user flows
